Spring Java framework basic functionality implementation

Task: Write your own framwork which will demonstrate next functionality:

1. Dependency Injection technology:
   - Parser of XML configuration file
   - @Autowired annotation (for constructor, method and field)
   - Class manager, which creates objects according to annotations
   - Class-tester, which will demonstrate usage of injected classes

2. Thread-safe singletone/prototype scope (the same as in Spring framework)

3. @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller annotations
